<h1 id="RedHeader">  MY RESIDENTIAL AREA</h1>
<center> <p>I grew up in Khayelitsha, the second largest township in South Africa and one of the crime-oriented places due to lack of infrastructure, unemployement and poverty. It was established in the 1980s due to Group Areas Act laws and now it has the most tourist attraction sites like the <a href="http://www.capetown.travel/activities/entry/khayelitsha_craft_market"> Khayelitsha Craft Market</a> and <a href="http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/urbanrenewal/Pages/LookoutHillTourismCentre.aspx">Look-Out Hill tourist facility </a> to name few. It has more sport facilities catering for soccer, rugby, cricket and basket ball for aspiring sportsman and special schools for academics. </p> </center>
