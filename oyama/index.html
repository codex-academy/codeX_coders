<hl>MY Background AND Roots </hl>

<p>I am Oyama  Siphula ,I was Born in 1993 on the 12th day of December.I was born and brought in Paarl Hospital by a lady called ''Minki'' then Xoleka Siphula was my mother's real name given by Gloria Siphula.I'm currently living in Paarl ,Mbekweni in Chris Hani location.I have only one brother Onke Siphula (2002) it is now 12 of age.I'm intrested in mostly in Tech but also with some educational knowlagde in order for me to monuever.</p>

<p>I started schooling in 1995 at Inomzamo pre school and I graduted in 1999 praperaring for that next coming year for Primary School.I began my Primary school in 2000 at Imboniselo when I was 7 years old of age perhaps other children were going to school when they are 6 years of age and at some point I thought I was old enough to be starting school,but panics was never an option that would've helped I end up rolling till I got done with my lower grades.At that stage I was only left with my grandma (T.G Siphula) ,Because my mother passed away,leaving me and my brother(Onke) with behind with only one person who was incharge for us.Since then I learnt a lesson that it is not worth to relly on onether person becouse of this death that is proud and that it's my(your) responsibility  to live life to its best just for the sake of a better tomorrow(Future).</p>

<p>I never thought I would ask myself lot of questions and answer them without consulting anyone when there is a need.When I was doing grade 9 things were seem to more complecated than before and by the way I was wishing to be one of South African popular Dj's that would bring the real world to people  who like music as the time went on,my grandmother bought me a computer for me in order to not struggle with my CAT(Computer Application Technology) Study and just incase if would need something else that I would value it in terms of my career.I experianced lot of problems with it by curiosity.I liked to very much to experiment things assuming that everything will be easy.I once met a guy known as Chris the guy was from outside the boarder.Chris helped me a lot about Technological stuff more special with computer hardware and softwares.He extremely inspired me heonce told me that the more I'm experiancing problems, I would gain more knowladge but by working those problem out.</p> 


<p>I did my secondery education in Desmond Mpilo Tutu Seniour Secondary school.I chosed to be in a science field because my grandma once told me that my mother also focused on a science career and that my mother was to be a nurse and thats what exactly encouraged me to focus on learning.I studied till I get to grade 12 whereby I done a good work, because I obtained symbol D as one of my achievements but separetely than of the skills I have which is of moving on with life Digitally and dynamically all these years.</p>

<p>I'm currently attending project codeX .Actually codeX is growing agile developers in Africa which I also want to be wthin three months period by doing my best and its qiute fun that each an every day I always waking up knowing that there is something new I will learn with my team and that is a daily basis activity.Now I'm just looking forward to more challenging Tech world whereby I will do amazing things I never thought htat I can actually do like coding using Hyper Text Markup Language.Im having a new friend so called internet and that special friend will lead me to be a better person as I see myself as a Pro of Software Developing.</p>

<p>In other words I can say the pain was motivating me,my grandmather as my encourager and chris as my career adviser.I would like to trullY recommand that no one's limited to life in fact people mustn't live without hope and for that reason nothing might seem to be consequently imposible .All in all knowlagde is weightless ,a treasure you can always carry easy and there's Albert Einstein's line which I like most, it states that''the only source of knwladge is experiance'' therefore it begins with me.</p>
